                Son, come closer with that candle, so I can share with you four
                stories, three decisions, two concepts, and one scenario. Now, pay close attention. <br> 
                Love and Justice <br> 
                Our first story was named
                properly to be "The prostitute shown love." Many moons back
                there was a prostitute in town. She had sinned and broken the
                law of Moses, so when they presented her to Jesus, He had two
                decisions: either to punish her as the law stated or to forgive
                her. If Jesus showed her love, mercy, and forgave her and then
                tried to convince the Pharisees to do the same then He would
                have directly undermined the law and doing so undermined the
                whole Justice department that He was supposedly supposed to
                uphold. In condemning her by punishment and following the law of
                Moses concerning adultery, then He would have left the love city
                in the process...

                things, you know. They never used to want that much, just my
                attention used to put them at ease and make them feel safe. They
                were all once like you too, you know. Before the addiction, the
                compulsory smoking and unending drinking, they used to be good,
                Elie, like really good, with dreams, ambitions, goals, to do
                lists, and all of that. They used to have it all...

                One day we wake up, and we tell ourselves that murder is evil,
                but under the right circumstances, it is justifiable (in other
                words, "good"). As we walk down the street, we see people half
                naked, and we think that it is acceptable by the culture card
                (in other words "good"). As we get to work, calling your
                colleague a man is an unforgivable sin under the freedom of
                transgender (in other words calling a born man "woman" is
                "good"). Well, when the day gets stressful, and you want to bow
                your head down and pray to the one that created you, that’s a

                just not for faith, not for righteousness, definitely not for
                holiness. No we fight: for unit, equality and individuality.
                Unity because we started thinking color is the judge of
                superiority; equality because at some point we thought women
                were lesser being; individuality because a man just want to
                marry another man without being judged. Well I do miss the old

                If we look at our lives we can always pinpoint that time where
                we left Him, around that specific moment. Because in the start,

                leave His presence. In case of trouble, we could hide right
                behind His scary stature, and we know we will be safe. If
                anything good happened, He was the first person to know, and He
                was always the last person to talk to before we went into a deep
                sleep. He was always there, and we were always there. It was a
                perfect, authentic, beautiful relationship. He carried us,
                taught us all we know, opened every single door, and walked us
                through every single step of the way. <br> At one point, we started thinking we were maybe a little too smart for Him, and we are probably a little too old to hang out with Him anymore. We started taking credit for what He did calling ourselves "self-made."...
